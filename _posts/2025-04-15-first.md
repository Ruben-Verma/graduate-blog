**Triberg**

During Easter, my friends and I decided to go to Triberg in the Schwarzwald. Schwarzwald is known for its beautiful landscape and for the Triberger Waterfalls, which are among the highest waterfalls in Germany.

The hike to the waterfalls was really nice. The path went through the forest, and it was peaceful to walk under the tall trees. When we reached the waterfalls, it was interesting to see how they looked in real life. The water flowed down several levels, and the sound of it was calming. It was cool to see how the water had shaped the rocks and the area around it.

There were a few spots along the trail where we could stop and take photos or just enjoy the view. We also saw some squirrels jumping between the trees, which added a nice touch to the walk. Even though it was a bit chilly, the fresh air and quiet surroundings made the whole experience very enjoyable. We took our time, talked, and just enjoyed being out in nature together.
